    * Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Distribute haval-paper.pdf and not
      haval.ps.

2003-01-20  Lawrence Teo  <lteo@calyptix.com>

    * All source files: Added/updated preambles to reflect new license.

2003-01-19  Lawrence Teo  <lteo@calyptix.com>

    * Repackaged for Calyptix Security Corporation.
    * Relicensed under the BSD license.
    * Created this ChangeLog.
    * TODO: Added. To-do list.
    * COPYING.BSD: Added. The BSD license.
    * INSTALL: Added. Build and installation instructions.
    * Used GNU autoconf and automake to facilitate project management.
    * Tested compilation with Debian GNU/Linux 3.0/x86, Red Hat
      Linux 8.0/x86, OpenBSD 3.0/x86, and Solaris 8/SPARC,
    * configure.in: Added.
    * Makefile.am: Added. Forced -Wall switch to gcc, so that all
      warnings are displayed.
    * acinclude.m4: Added. Self-defined m4 macros.
    * bootstrap: Added. Bootstraps the project by invoking the
      autotools.
    * configure.in: Enabled the user to specify number of passes with
      the --with-num-passes switch to the configure switch, e.g.
      ./configure --with-num-passes=3
    * configure.in: Enabled fingerprint length to be specified
      using --with-fpt-len.
    * configure.in: Enabled number of test blocks to be specified
      using --with-test-blocks.
    * configure.in: Enabled test block size to be specified using
      --with-block-size.
    * configure.in: Preliminary check for endianness, so that user
      does not have to define/undefine LITTLE_ENDIAN manually. Still
      needs more work, since LITTLE_ENDIAN exists in
      /usr/include/endian.h on Linux systems.
    * configure.in: Added the --enable-extra-optimization switch,
      which will get gcc to perform extra optimization (for i686 only).
    * havaltest.c: Added Id tag to facilitate binary identification.
    * havaltest.c: When producing the hash of a file (say, file.txt),
      print HAVAL(file.txt) instead of HAVAL(File file.txt) to make
      it more consistent with other hashing programs.
    * havaltest.c (usage): New. Usage is now printed in a more uniform
      manner like other UNIX software.
    * havaltest.c: Include config.h instead of havalapp.h.
    * haval.c: Added Id tag to facilitate binary identification.
    * haval.c: s/VERSION/HAVAL_VERSION/ to avoid conflicts and
      confusion with package version generated by autotools.
    * haval.c (haval_stdin): Fixed bug where hash of stdin produces
      raw characters. Now produces regular hexadecimal output.
    * haval.c (haval_stdin): Got rid of compile warning because of the
      use of assignment as a truth value without parentheses.
    * haval.c (haval_file): Got rid of compile warning because of the
      use of assignment as a truth value without parentheses.
    * havalapp.h: Moving towards deprecation, once config.h is
      stabilized.

    * haval.c: Corrected the first byte in padding[128]
      (from 0x80 to 0x01).
    * Thanks go to Paulo Barreto (pbarreto@uninet.com.br) who
      detected the padding error while implementing HAVAL
      independently.

1996-04-01  Yuliang Zheng  <yuliang@calyptix.com>

    * haval.c: Added #include <string.h>
    * haval.c: Deleted #include <memory.h>
    * haval.c: Appended 'L' to all 32-bit constants.
    * Many thanks to Ross Williams (ross@rocksoft.com) for his
      invaluable comments on the previous version of the code.
    * havaltest.c: Now we use CPU time, instead of elapsed time to
      measure the speed of HAVAL.
