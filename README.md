# HAVAL

HAVAL is a one-way hashing algorithm with the following collision-resistant property: it is computationally infeasible to find two or more messages that are hashed into the same fingerprint.

This library provides routines to hash
* a buffer of specified length,
* a string, and
* a stream.
